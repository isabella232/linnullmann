And yet that is what Linn Ullmann has done in this impressive and highly readable book."

  #   quote_markdown: "It is categorised as a novel, but poetry is never far away in this endeavour not to forget two ever-playful parents and a child who was always too grown-up. Linn Ullmann’s _De urolige_ is perhaps mainly a book about the creative process, about literature and art. A wonderful book!"

  #   quote_markdown: "Linn Ullmann conjures up images of her parents with bravura … The leaps in time allow Ullmann to turn memories into poetry without this encroaching too much on the delicate prose. Did certain things happen just once, or time and again? Did they carry on throughout a childhood? The language is exceedingly elegant and at times extraordinary. I am impressed by the ease with which she can abruptly change theme in the midst of a gently paced passage. Page-long sentences are steered with a lightness of touch and breath."

  #   quote_markdown: "… the best thing I have read by Linn Ullmann and one of the best books I have read this year … a scintillatingly good work of fiction. The narrative flows so smoothly that one feels it could not have been told in any other way … places and moods are captured with a unique immediacy that brands these images on the mind, there to mingle with one’s own memories."

  #   quote_markdown: "I cannot remember ever reading Linn Ullmann in such sparkling and fiendishly witty form … The pages of this almost intoxicatingly well-written novel are imbued with verve and creativity, sensitivity and ruthless wit … There is daring and clear-sightedness in the writer’s reflections and recollections, with never a hint of romanticization … a bold and convincing novel."

  #   quote_markdown: "When children set out to write about their parents the result can easily take on the form of an indictment. Ullmann dwells instead on what we never can become privy to in a way that affords interesting observations … a deft and convincing tale of memory, belonging and parenthood."

  #   quote_markdown: "Brutal and beautiful … a tremendous read … the narrative is pared to the bone and it is this that makes it so telling … The fine balance between the universal and the quite specific renders this novel vibrant with intensity. Its author neatly avoids falling into the obvious traps facing a child writing about famous parents … _De urolige_ is a wise and generous account of the difficult, strange, fine, harsh and intolerable things that occur within families."

  #   quote_markdown: "[Ullmann] plays scenes, edits tightly and to a great extent leaves it up to the spectator to make up their own mind about what is presented. The resulting work is in a class of its own. Ullmann maintains her distance and her clarity of vision even in such a close and revealing portrait of her own parents … Every line is imbued with significance and great immediacy, gravity and humour going hand in hand, effortlessly and consummately."

  #   quote_markdown: "… one of the year’s most powerful narratives … Behind beautifully turned sentences lie complex emotions and painful experiences … This is a courageous work, constantly walking the tightrope between the exquisite and the grotesque … a moving and tender book, one which prompts the reader to look back on their own memories, remember long buried stories. And isn’t that one of the best things literature can do?"

  #   quote_markdown: "masterly … This novel enters into a dialogue with some of the greatest names in literature. Writers like Proust and Beckett. But Ullmann herself is a writer of such calibre that she succeeds in referencing these works, not an echo chamber, but as a room for reflection … one of the very best books of the year."

  #   quote_markdown: "Luminous and effortless … A wry and playful book, full of references to film, music and literature. And a serious work, deeply moving. Not one sentence here is without significance. And when you close it, it is of course yourself you have seen. This is one of those rare books which stays with you long afterwards."

  #   quote_markdown: "a powerful read … Ullmann weaves together memories and documentary material, imaginings and meditations with an exquisite lightness of touch … a moving chronicle of this extraordinary family … in the depictions of her father’s descent into old age and death her words glow like phosphorescence in dark water … Several times while reading this book I found myself thinking of Joan Didion’s fluent descriptions of her own bereavement in _The Year of Magical Thinking_. It would not surprise me if _De urolige_ were also to become an international bestseller."

  #   quote_markdown: "This is powerful stuff, but also simply brilliant… in terms of its genre, scale and content _De urolige_ is an exceptionally ambitious project and Ullmann composes, cuts and splices the whole thing together with consummate skill … It takes a truly gifted writer to succeed with a project such as this … the result is a brilliant novel. Ullmann’s language, her ability to make everything vibrate, to render even her father’s feet on his deathbed poetic, put her in a whole other league than most other contemporary Norwegian writers."

    quote_markdown: "I’ve long admired Linn Ullmann’s fiction, and Unquiet is her masterpiece. Based on her upbringing as the child of two great artists, it is the portrait of complex loves; of a youth divided and inspired by diametrically opposed creative influences; and of the ravages of age. Calm yet fierce, exquisitely rendered, this novel imprints itself indelibly―as if you, too, had been there."
