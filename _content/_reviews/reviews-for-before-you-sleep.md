    quote_markdown: "Norwegian author and critic Ullmann debuts with this intriguing, looping meditation on the history of the Blom family, told by young Karin in jagged, emotionally oblique prose … Density accrues in vivid, impressionistically recalled scenes, rather than in sophisticated plot devices, and the emotional acuity is highly original, and often absorbing"

    quote_markdown: "Ullmann’s touch is light as she explores a range of fiery topics. Immigration, assimilation, sibling rivalry, romance, fidelity, infidelity, patriotism, honor, and loyalty are woven into this slice-of-life look at one clan struggling to love and support its own. Originally published in Norway, this novel is currently a number one best seller throughout Scandinavia. Luckily, American readers will soon be able to join European fans in singing its praises. Highly recommended"

    quote_markdown: "A rich portrayal of mother-daughter relationships, Ullmann’s ambitious first novel spans nearly 70 years and four generations of a Norwegian family perpetually in battle with itself … Ullmann deftly offsets her slow-building drama with Karin’s fantasy sequences and perversely uproarious caricatures of family members. Ullmann, who has lived in both Oslo and New York, always provides fine background detail, but it is the irrepressible Blom women who attract the reader’s sympathy"

    quote_markdown: "Linn Ullmann’s eloquent first novel … _Before You Sleep_ has its own sophisticated literary shape and a fine eye for the subterfuges that lurk beneath marriages and love affairs … With its many flashbacks and its meditative approach, the story entices readers with a gentle rhythm, as if it were a bedtime story giving way to a nightmare … a perceptive and sparkling new creation"
