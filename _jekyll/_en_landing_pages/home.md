##### [*The Cold Song*](/en/books/the-cold-song/), published by Other Press

“Ullmann is very good at evoking the peculiar, charged stasis of a household in which mentally active and intellectually vital people are resolutely failing to communicate with each other—the loneliness of communality, in short. She is a very exact writer, who is unsparing of her characters: a tonic, sharp, lyrical, intelligent novelist who deserves to be better-known in English.”

— [James Wood, *The New Yorker*](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/favorite-books-2014)
