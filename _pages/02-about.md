**Linn Ullmann** (born 1966) is a graduate of New York University, where she studied English literature and began work on her Ph.D. When her first and critically acclaimed novel *Before You Sleep* was published in 1998, she was already known as an influential literary critic. Her second novel, *Stella Descending* was published in 2001 and her third novel *Grace* was published in 2002. For *Grace* Linn Ullmann received the literary award The Reader’s Prize in Norway and *Grace* was named one of the top ten novels that year by the prestigious newspaper *Weekendavisen* in Denmark.
