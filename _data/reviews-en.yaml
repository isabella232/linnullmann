The novel’s charm lies in these idiosyncratic glints, these glimmers of queer wit, uncensored scorn or sudden, unstinting sympathy."

 quote: "*The Cold Song* is a wonderful book, like a family album made by a photographer who really cares for his subjects. I love the way Ullmann deals with time and perspective. Her complete freedom to jump from one character to the next and back and forth in time holds the book together as one big picture of a somehow dysfunctional and still completely normal family&mdash;a family I loved to spend time with. I admire her ability to slip into the characters of men, women, and children with ease and make them completely believable—the philandering Jon is a masterpiece. The book has the light but also the weight of a Bergman film. It doesn’t offer easy solutions but still has a kind of healing power."

 quote: "In the three novels prior to *A Blessed Child*, Ullmann (who lives in Oslo) proved beyond doubt that her talent trumped her genes… It's surely a sign of swelling confidence that *A Blessed Child* should superficially reflect a few details of her family background and yet make its luminous mark as a work of pure imagination… Ullmann excels just as much as a satirist as a psychologist. She paints a bitingly witty picture of middle-class Oslo … Ullmann evokes the 'stubborn little island' wonderfully … carry faint echoes of Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse on the Baltic breeze … First affecting, then alarming, sometimes acerbically comic, *A Blessed Child* has an exhilarating candour and clarity in its grasp of family, period and place … Ullmann also hints at an undercurrent of political fable."

But once this is disclosed, Ullmann abruptly returns to the present and the novel ends, perhaps prematurely, with a cinematic flourish as the three sisters – who appear largely unaffected by the disturbing tragedy – set out in the falling snow for Hammarsö. Unsentimental to the end, this is a well-crafted and compelling read."
