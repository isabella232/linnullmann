 quote: "*The Cold Song* is a fluid, shape-shifting novel, a family saga that turns into an erotically charged drama and then  takes a darker turn into the terrain of a murder mystery. Linn Ullmann is an unusually talented and sympathetic writer, able to inhabit a wide range of characters and bring them all vividly to life."

This delicate, mesmerizing work attests to Ullmann’s vast storytelling powers."

 quote: "*The Cold Song* is a wonderful book, like a family album made by a photographer who really cares for his subjects. I love the way Ullmann deals with time and perspective. Her complete freedom to jump from one character to the next and back and forth in time holds the book together as one big picture of a somehow dysfunctional and still completely normal family&mdash;a family I loved to spend time with. I admire her ability to slip into the characters of men, women, and children with ease and make them completely believable—the philandering Jon is a masterpiece. The book has the light but also the weight of a Bergman film. It doesn’t offer easy solutions but still has a kind of healing power."

 quote: "Contrary to popular belief, a death is not merely an end but the beginning of a story. The death in *The Cold Song* opens a Pandora’s box of human emotions, conflicts and deceptions. Readers of this novel will be reminded of the joys and complexities of living. Memories, laughter, gestures, trivialities—everything casts a shadow, and nothing leaves us safe. Linn Ullmann has mastered the art of seeing into the dark mysteries that make us who we are."

Combining the tension of a whodunit with the subtlety of a domestic drama, Ullmann’s riveting novel is measured, impeccably observed, and utterly chilling."

 quote: "[*The Cold Song* is] a psychological tour de force&mdash;not a beat wrong. The ending crept up on me, so quiet and unexpected. It’s a brilliant scene, with everybody locked in character—in the *huit clos* finality of character&mdash;and it hits you the minute you put the book down. I stayed up half last night finishing it, and now I’m sitting bleary-eyed at my desk, paying for the pleasure."

 quote: "The fifth novel by an award-winning Norwegian author and critic deserves to win her a much larger stateside readership. The latest and best from Ullmann resists categorization, except as a literary page-turner. It’s a murder mystery. It’s a multigenerational psychodrama of a dysfunctional family. And it’s a very dark comedy of manners. Yet the authors command is such that it never reads like a pastiche or suffers from jarring shifts of tone."

Readers who appreciate an unconventional narrative flow will find this a deeply moving story of troubled relationships and unsettled memories."

 quote: "In the three novels prior to *A Blessed Child*, Ullmann (who lives in Oslo) proved beyond doubt that her talent trumped her genes… It's surely a sign of swelling confidence that *A Blessed Child* should superficially reflect a few details of her family background and yet make its luminous mark as a work of pure imagination… Ullmann excels just as much as a satirist as a psychologist. She paints a bitingly witty picture of middle-class Oslo … Ullmann evokes the 'stubborn little island' wonderfully … carry faint echoes of Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse on the Baltic breeze … First affecting, then alarming, sometimes acerbically comic, *A Blessed Child* has an exhilarating candour and clarity in its grasp of family, period and place … Ullmann also hints at an undercurrent of political fable."

We’re left at the end wondering if any of these children were blessed and what on earth they’ll say to Isak when they finally meet him at the ruined holiday home. The lack of a proper denouement is usually irritating in a novel, but here it is a strength."

-
 quote: "With clinical precision, Ullmann intersperses the details of each sister’s life during the intervening years with vivid flashbacks of their childhood summers, all the while maintaining a masterful suspense, her spare prose coolly revealing the series of events leading up to the climactic ‘dark secret’ at the heart of the novel.  But once this is disclosed, Ullmann abruptly returns to the present and the novel ends, perhaps prematurely, with a cinematic flourish as the three sisters – who appear largely unaffected by the disturbing tragedy – set out in the falling snow for Hammarsö. Unsentimental to the end, this is a well-crafted and compelling read."
