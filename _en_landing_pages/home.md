> <strong>“</strong>
Unquiet is a wonderfully absorbing and moving family story told with a directness, naturalness, and grace that can only result from Linn Ullmann’s close attention to the eloquent details of day-to-day life, her honest embrace of herself and the people close to her, and a keen sensitivity to language and the high demands of good writing.

<strong>— Lydia Davis, author of The End of the Story</strong>
 

> <strong>“</strong>
I’ve long admired Linn Ullmann’s fiction, and Unquiet is her masterpiece. Based on her upbringing as the child of two great artists, it is the portrait of complex loves; of a youth divided and inspired by diametrically opposed creative influences; and of the ravages of age. Calm yet fierce, exquisitely rendered, this novel imprints itself indelibly―as if you, too, had been there.

<strong>— Claire Messud, author of The Burning Girl</strong>
 

> <strong>“</strong>
Ullmann moves deftly between narrative selves over time―from the little girl’s raw bewilderments to the adult’s reflective meditations. Unquiet is a beautiful book about the emotion and the art of memory.

<strong>— Siri Hustvedt, author of The Blazing World</strong>
 

> <strong>“</strong>
With singular imagination and generosity, Linn Ullmann breaks new ground in the art of memory, transporting us into the sources of magic in her life with her enchanting parents.
