Linn Ullmann’s elegant and concise novel is a study of life and its exquisite banality . . .it is exactly this ordinariness, and Ullmann’s ability to get the arguments and moments of tenderness just so, that makes the novel so quietly devastating . . . _Grace_ is, in a sense , about what happens in between, the major and minor events that occur over the course of any given day.Ullmann’s triumph is that even when dealing with the weightiest of these she has the lightest of touches.
