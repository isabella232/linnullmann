In its very form replicating the fitful progress of memory, it is written and translated (from the Norwegian, by author and translator) with care, insight, a keen sensitivity to the value of every word, and a generous embrace of human strengths and weaknesses. I had the rare experience, as I read it, of at once admiring the way it was written and being engrossed in the story.
