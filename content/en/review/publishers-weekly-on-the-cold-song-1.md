The discovery of a corpse, presumed to be a murder victim, comes very early in this involving fifth novel from Ullmann. But it serves mostly as a basis for the author’s subtle and menacing look at family dynamics…Ullmann teeters between dark comedy of manners and genuine psychological thriller, but she consistently captures the telling moments in everyday encounters, and writes seductively complex characters.
