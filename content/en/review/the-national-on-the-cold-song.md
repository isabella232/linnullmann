\[A\] layer of human complexity …elevates Nordic noir to something more than simple genre fiction… Norwegian novelist Linn ­Ullmann’s masterful fifth novel The Cold Song, while not technically a crime thriller as such, is something of a case in point – borrowing elements of the genre but combining them with those of a subtle dark domestic drama, she’s written a technically adventurous hybrid that delivers in terms of complexity of characters, the darkness of an original Grimm’s fairy tale and the heightened atmosphere of a tense thriller.
