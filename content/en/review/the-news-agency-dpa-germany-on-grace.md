The Norwegian author Linn Ullmann is a master of literary density. In her new novel _Grace_, she once again succeeds in raising the existential questions of mankind in compact form, thus touching the reader’s feelings … There is hardly one single reader who will not be affected by _Grace_. The book evokes grief, but its unsentimental style offers comforts as well.
