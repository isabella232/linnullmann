… one of the year’s most powerful narratives … Behind beautifully turned sentences lie complex emotions and painful experiences … This is a courageous work, constantly walking the tightrope between the exquisite and the grotesque … a moving and tender book, one which prompts the reader to look back on their own memories, remember long buried stories. And isn’t that one of the best things literature can do?
