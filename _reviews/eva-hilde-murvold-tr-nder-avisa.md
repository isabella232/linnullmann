[Ullmann] plays scenes, edits tightly and to a great extent leaves it up to the spectator to make up their own mind about what is presented. The resulting work is in a class of its own. Ullmann maintains her distance and her clarity of vision even in such a close and revealing portrait of her own parents … Every line is imbued with significance and great immediacy, gravity and humour going hand in hand, effortlessly and consummately.
