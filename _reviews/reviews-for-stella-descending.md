    quote_markdown: "… her talent is as unique as it is prodigious. Her first novel, Before You Sleep, was received to international acclaim. Her second, so often an author’s stumbling block, confirms Ullmann as a writer of empathy and poise. In spare, beautifully crafted prose, _Stella Descending_ whittles away the deceptions that pervade our intimate relationships to expose a gnawing isolation from which only a temporary respite seems possible. It is a painful, deeply distressing novel and yet its cumulative impact produces the opposite- the kind of elation you can get only in the presence of great art."

    quote_markdown: "Ullmann’s grasp of the ambiguous natures of her people and her understanding of their background is admirably strong. The governing metaphor of the fall, and of the density in those two seconds, is at once poetic and intellectually satisfying … she has a keenness of ear and eye, and a sharpness of mind, that is all her own."

    quote_markdown: "Ullmann is a fine writer, complex, intelligent and scrupulous. The drama of private life, and of the here and now, continues to require voices such as hers."
