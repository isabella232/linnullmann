Although her language sparkles and shines, although she has a ruthless eye for human failings, although she succeeds in imparting something vital to the vilest of relationships, I would still claim that Linn Ullmann’s strength lies in her structural command … Her distinctive quality as a writer is quite simply—grace. And there is nothing simple about that.
