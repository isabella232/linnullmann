In these Knausg√•rd days, who would have thought it possible for anyone to write such a perceptive, wise and objective, but at the same time tender and heart-felt story of growing up with parents like Liv Ullmann and Ingmar Bergman? And yet that is what Linn Ullmann has done in this impressive and highly readable book.
