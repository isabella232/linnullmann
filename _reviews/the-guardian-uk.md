some of the passages on the sisters’ relationships are handled with quite brilliant economy … The book is not humourless; indeed, there are flourishes of great warmth in the rapport between the sisters … Ullmann has a real gift for conveying childhood and the cosiest moments lie in those lovely passages … Ullmann wants us to be patient as she is patient, and it’s worth it; for the accomplished writing
