I cannot remember ever reading Linn Ullmann in such sparkling and fiendishly witty form … The pages of this almost intoxicatingly well-written novel are imbued with verve and creativity, sensitivity and ruthless wit … There is daring and clear-sightedness in the writer’s reflections and recollections, with never a hint of romanticization … a bold and convincing novel.
