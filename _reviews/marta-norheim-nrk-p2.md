Brutal and beautiful … a tremendous read … the narrative is pared to the bone and it is this that makes it so telling … The fine balance between the universal and the quite specific renders this novel vibrant with intensity. Its author neatly avoids falling into the obvious traps facing a child writing about famous parents … _De urolige_ is a wise and generous account of the difficult, strange, fine, harsh and intolerable things that occur within families.
