… the best thing I have read by Linn Ullmann and one of the best books I have read this year … a scintillatingly good work of fiction. The narrative flows so smoothly that one feels it could not have been told in any other way … places and moods are captured with a unique immediacy that brands these images on the mind, there to mingle with one’s own memories.
