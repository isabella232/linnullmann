Linn Ullmann’s eloquent first novel … _Before You Sleep_ has its own sophisticated literary shape and a fine eye for the subterfuges that lurk beneath marriages and love affairs … With its many flashbacks and its meditative approach, the story entices readers with a gentle rhythm, as if it were a bedtime story giving way to a nightmare … a perceptive and sparkling new creation
