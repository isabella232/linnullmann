Linn Ullmann conjures up images of her parents with bravura … The leaps in time allow Ullmann to turn memories into poetry without this encroaching too much on the delicate prose. Did certain things happen just once, or time and again? Did they carry on throughout a childhood? The language is exceedingly elegant and at times extraordinary. I am impressed by the ease with which she can abruptly change theme in the midst of a gently paced passage. Page-long sentences are steered with a lightness of touch and breath.
