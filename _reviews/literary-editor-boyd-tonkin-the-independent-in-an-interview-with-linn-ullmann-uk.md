Starting with _Before You Sleep_ in 1998, Ullmann has published four novels. Spare, terse and austerely beautiful studies on the cusp of change or calamity, this is clear-sighted, large-hearted fiction without illusions but never without pity – or without humour …. Ullmann traces Johan’s journey into sickness with an elegant literary grammar of cuts, close-ups and flashbacks
