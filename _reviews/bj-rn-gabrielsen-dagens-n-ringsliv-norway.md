A terrifying novel that is difficult to put down…Ullmann combines keen everyday observations with an obscure crime, but the dialogues also pose a number of recurring philosophical questions. Where is the border between a lie and a narrative?…an alternately riveting, humorous, and thought-provoking novel that captivates.
