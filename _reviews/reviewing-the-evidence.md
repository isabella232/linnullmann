[The Cold Song] is a finely-tuned and cool treatment of the tensions in a modern familyâ€¦Lin Ullman is the daughter of Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullman and the book has something of the quality of the films the two made together. Much is unspoken, much must be inferred, but the psychological atmosphere of the novel settles over the reader and enfolds us, making us determined to find out what we can about these characters who are so vividly alive in all their flaws and imperfections.
