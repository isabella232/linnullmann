Linn Ullmann casts a wonderfully caustic eye on human flaws…With elegant circular movements Ullmann writes her way into all that one cannot talk about in a family.…[Ullmann] stands more in the tradition of the great bourgeois novel (Balzac, Stendhal, Lagerlöf)…A trace of Virginia Woolf can be heard in _The Cold Song_…easy and compelling, [Ullmann] dissects human weakness, grief, and pain.
