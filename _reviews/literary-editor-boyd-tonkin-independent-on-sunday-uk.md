In the three novels prior to _A Blessed Child_, Ullmann (who lives in Oslo) proved beyond doubt that her talent trumped her genes… It’s surely a sign of swelling confidence that _A Blessed Child_ should superficially reflect a few details of her family background and yet make its luminous mark as a work of pure imagination… Ullmann excels just as much as a satirist as a psychologist. She paints a bitingly witty picture of middle-class Oslo … Ullmann evokes the ‘stubborn little island’ wonderfully … carry faint echoes of Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse on the Baltic breeze … First affecting, then alarming, sometimes acerbically comic, _A Blessed Child_ has an exhilarating candour and clarity in its grasp of family, period and place … Ullmann also hints at an undercurrent of political fable.
