In this extraordinarily fearless novel Linn Ullmann invites us inside fear itself … This is a work of the most intricate and impressive artistry, with past and present, fantasy and stark actuality, emotion and the clinically physical, not so much juxtaposed as flowing in and out of each other, like themes in a piano work by Maia’s admired Schumann. There is also, paradoxically, much humour … [an] exemplary account of an unremarkable but unique man’s journey to the moment of death and beyond
