The 38 year old Norwegian author Linn Ullmann has written a subdued, lucid story on themes that are easy to grasp, slightly mocking at times, and often quite melancholy â€¦ *Grace* shows something that is perhaps only possible to convey through literature; the unique quality of the death of each single person.
