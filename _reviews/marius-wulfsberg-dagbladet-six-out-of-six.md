a powerful read … Ullmann weaves together memories and documentary material, imaginings and meditations with an exquisite lightness of touch … a moving chronicle of this extraordinary family … in the depictions of her father’s descent into old age and death her words glow like phosphorescence in dark water … Several times while reading this book I found myself thinking of Joan Didion’s fluent descriptions of her own bereavement in _The Year of Magical Thinking_. It would not surprise me if _De urolige_ were also to become an international bestseller.
