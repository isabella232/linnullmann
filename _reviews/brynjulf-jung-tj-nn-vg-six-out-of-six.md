This is powerful stuff, but also simply brilliant… in terms of its genre, scale and content _De urolige_ is an exceptionally ambitious project and Ullmann composes, cuts and splices the whole thing together with consummate skill … It takes a truly gifted writer to succeed with a project such as this … the result is a brilliant novel. Ullmann’s language, her ability to make everything vibrate, to render even her father’s feet on his deathbed poetic, put her in a whole other league than most other contemporary Norwegian writers.
