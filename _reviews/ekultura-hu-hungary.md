Reading _The Cold Song_ was an unforgettable experience. The novel is a remarkably composed puzzle, where the fragmented structure is not an experiment in deconstructing the traditional novel form. The Cold Song is an ingenious game with structural elements. The characters…are real human beings and the depiction of their pain and sorrow serve as…an attempt at a healing process.
