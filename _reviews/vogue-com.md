The death of a teenage au pair in a dark wood touches off Norwegian author Linn Ullmann’s breakout fifth novel, The Cold Song, in which the question of culpability unearths a treasure trove of tantalizing family secrets. Set at an elegant estate on Norway’s seacoast, this spare, irresistibly moody inquiry into one family’s collective memory is populated with richly ambiguous characters.
