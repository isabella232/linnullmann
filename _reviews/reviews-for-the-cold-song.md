    quote_markdown: "…Linn Ullmann published an excellent, formidable novel this year…Ullmann is very good at evoking the peculiar, charged stasis of a household in which mentally active and intellectually vital people are resolutely failing to communicate with each other—the loneliness of communality, in short. She is a very exact writer, who is unsparing of her characters: a tonic, sharp, lyrical, intelligent novelist who deserves to be better-known in English."

    quote_markdown: "…steeped in dread the way a fruitcake is steeped in rum: Every page, every line, seems to glisten with vapors of sumptuous, intoxicating unease…Ullmann’s voice on the page is a lean, tough-minded thing, scrubbed and scoured of sentimentality straight through to the final, Carveresque pages, in which she pulls off an 11th-hour radiance, a tonal shift from minor to major key."

    quote_markdown: "The death of a teenage au pair in a dark wood touches off Norwegian author Linn Ullmann’s breakout fifth novel, The Cold Song, in which the question of culpability unearths a treasure trove of tantalizing family secrets. Set at an elegant estate on Norway’s seacoast, this spare, irresistibly moody inquiry into one family’s collective memory is populated with richly ambiguous characters."

    quote_markdown: "[A] layer of human complexity …elevates Nordic noir to something more than simple genre fiction… Norwegian novelist Linn ­Ullmann’s masterful fifth novel The Cold Song, while not technically a crime thriller as such, is something of a case in point – borrowing elements of the genre but combining them with those of a subtle dark domestic drama, she’s written a technically adventurous hybrid that delivers in terms of complexity of characters, the darkness of an original Grimm’s fairy tale and the heightened atmosphere of a tense thriller."

    quote_markdown: "The prose is taut, yet the pace is languid as summer in that before-the-storm tension…The real achievement of this novel is Ullmann’s gift to imbue the tension of a thriller via the unease of the mundane… The Cold Song is more a mystery in the way most families tend to be mysteries unto themselves."

    quote_markdown: "The fifth novel by an award-winning Norwegian author and critic deserves to win her a much larger stateside readership. The latest and best from Ullmann resists categorization, except as a literary page-turner. It’s a murder mystery. It’s a multigenerational psychodrama of a dysfunctional family. And it’s a very dark comedy of manners. Yet the author’s command is such that it never reads like a pastiche or suffers from jarring shifts of tone… [Ullmann] might be best known in this country as the daughter of Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann, but her accomplishment here merits more than recognition by association."

    quote_markdown: "Two things stand out in this excellent book. The first is the seamless movement of multiple complex characters through several years of time plus flashbacks to a tragedy in Siri’s early childhood…The second is the impossibly perfect ending…Leo Tolstoy’s assessment of relationships, All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, rings true in The Cold Song. The ugly secrets and tragic deaths are peculiar to Jenny Brodal and those who surround her, but Linn Ullmann’s careful revelations and delicate timing are evocative and believable to all of us — from happy and unhappy families alike."

    quote_markdown: "The discovery of a corpse, presumed to be a murder victim, comes very early in this involving fifth novel from Ullmann. But it serves mostly as a basis for the author’s subtle and menacing look at family dynamics…Ullmann teeters between dark comedy of manners and genuine psychological thriller, but she consistently captures the telling moments in everyday encounters, and writes seductively complex characters."

    quote_markdown: "The Cold Song doesn’t so much as unfold as it revolves, around the sudden disappearance of Milla, the young and beautiful summer nanny hired to take care of Siri and Jon’s two children. The real ‘meat’ of the novel rests in its keen and unflinching exposure of the inner lives of its characters, revealed in brief narrative spurts that shift back and forth in time. The result is riveting."

    quote_markdown: "[The Cold Song] is a finely-tuned and cool treatment of the tensions in a modern family…Lin Ullman is the daughter of Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullman and the book has something of the quality of the films the two made together. Much is unspoken, much must be inferred, but the psychological atmosphere of the novel settles over the reader and enfolds us, making us determined to find out what we can about these characters who are so vividly alive in all their flaws and imperfections."

    quote_markdown: "_The Cold Song_ is a wonderful book, like a family album made by a photographer who really cares for his subjects. I love the way Ullmann deals with time and perspective. Her complete freedom to jump from one character to the next and back and forth in time holds the book together as one big picture of a somehow dysfunctional and still completely normal family—a family I loved to spend time with. I admire her ability to slip into the characters of men, women, and children with ease and make them completely believable—the philandering Jon is a masterpiece. The book has the light but also the weight of a Bergman film. It doesn’t offer easy solutions but still has a kind of healing power."

    quote_markdown: "Contrary to popular belief, a death is not merely an end but the beginning of a story. The death in _The Cold Song_ opens a Pandora’s box of human emotions, conflicts and deceptions. Readers of this novel will be reminded of the joys and complexities of living. Memories, laughter, gestures, trivialities—everything casts a shadow, and nothing leaves us safe. Linn Ullmann has mastered the art of seeing into the dark mysteries that make us who we are."

    quote_markdown: "[_The Cold Song_ is] a psychological tour de force—not a beat wrong. The ending crept up on me, so quiet and unexpected. It’s a brilliant scene, with everybody locked in character—in the _huit clos_ finality of character—and it hits you the minute you put the book down. I stayed up half last night finishing it, and now I’m sitting bleary-eyed at my desk, paying for the pleasure."
