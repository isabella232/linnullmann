Linn Ullmann is a novelist and one of her most beautiful novels is _Grace_. This book leaves an impression which overwhelms everything. Linn Ullmann need not use thorough explanations. She observes. She lets her characters relate. In simple sentences. But, in mysterious ways these sentences capture even the most shaded feelings. Everything in this book is clear, but at the same time enigmatic as death itself. _Grace_ is a kind of book that gives us a feeling that books can make us better human beings. Concurrently it is fabulously dry, without sentimentality, but moving in almost every line. Linn Ullmann is a great artist and it is high time we in Germany get to know her
