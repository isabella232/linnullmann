Ullmann’s grasp of the ambiguous natures of her people and her understanding of their background is admirably strong. The governing metaphor of the fall, and of the density in those two seconds, is at once poetic and intellectually satisfying … she has a keenness of ear and eye, and a sharpness of mind, that is all her own.
