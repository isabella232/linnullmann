The Cold Song doesn’t so much as unfold as it revolves, around the sudden disappearance of Milla, the young and beautiful summer nanny hired to take care of Siri and Jon’s two children. The real ‘meat’ of the novel rests in its keen and unflinching exposure of the inner lives of its characters, revealed in brief narrative spurts that shift back and forth in time. The result is riveting.
