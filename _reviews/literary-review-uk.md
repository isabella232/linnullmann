Ullmann’s narrative is similarly unpredictable – cutting back and forth between women’s stories, past and present, weaving together snatches of children’s voices from long ago, passages of lyrical interpretation or humorous observation, all with strong authorial vision and perfect control … A rich, continually shifting stew of relationships gives this novel its depth and power. On Hammerso, the girls’ friendships with the other children, dissolving and re-forming with bewildering cruelty, are brilliantly and convincingly portrayed
