The prose is taut, yet the pace is languid as summer in that before-the-storm tension…The real achievement of this novel is Ullmann’s gift to imbue the tension of a thriller via the unease of the mundane… The Cold Song is more a mystery in the way most families tend to be mysteries unto themselves.
