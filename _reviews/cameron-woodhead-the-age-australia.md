… her talent is as unique as it is prodigious. Her first novel, Before You Sleep, was received to international acclaim. Her second, so often an author’s stumbling block, confirms Ullmann as a writer of empathy and poise. In spare, beautifully crafted prose, _Stella Descending_ whittles away the deceptions that pervade our intimate relationships to expose a gnawing isolation from which only a temporary respite seems possible. It is a painful, deeply distressing novel and yet its cumulative impact produces the opposite- the kind of elation you can get only in the presence of great art.
