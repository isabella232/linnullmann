With clinical precision, Ullmann intersperses the details of each sister’s life during the intervening years with vivid flashbacks of their childhood summers, all the while maintaining a masterful suspense, her spare prose coolly revealing the series of events leading up to the climactic ‘dark secret’ at the heart of the novel. But once this is disclosed, Ullmann abruptly returns to the present and the novel ends, perhaps prematurely, with a cinematic flourish as the three sisters – who appear largely unaffected by the disturbing tragedy – set out in the falling snow for Hammarsö. Unsentimental to the end, this is a well-crafted and compelling read.
